# Work Log

Track each completed step for fungcc so the history of decisions stays transparent.

## 2024-11-15
- Established project guidelines in `AGENTS.md` describing structure, tooling, and workflow.
- Captured upcoming milestones in `todo.txt` to guide compiler development.

- Created initial CMake project scaffolding with interface library stub and driver executable placeholder.
- Added canonical directory tree (src/frontend, include/, tests/unit, etc.) plus samples/ and docs/ roots.
- Verified build configuration conceptually; local `cmake` unavailable in environment, so compilation remains unvalidated.
